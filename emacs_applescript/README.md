# Apple Script
The following `quick-action` applications are written in `AppleScript` which are used to do specific task:
1. Launch `safari` using `command + b` or `alt + b`
2. Lanuch `iTerm` once you click `command + return` keystrokes.
3. Lanuch `Emacs` once you click `command + e` keystrokes.


## How it works
- All `AppleScript` are stored as `quick-action`.
- go to `automator` then create a new `work-flow` select no `input` script in the top banner.
- You will need to write the scripts first or use the `stow` command to restor them.
    - The location of the `applescript` is under the `~/Library/Services/`
- Setting the shortcuts with the quick-action is done using `setting->keyboard->keyboard_shortcuts` then `App Shortcuts`.
- You have to provide the exact name for the shortcut, the names can be found at `Finder-> Services`.
