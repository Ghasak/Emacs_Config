<h1 id="eval-and-replace">Eval and Replace</h1>
<p>I start to use <code>Emacs</code> after seeing this feature which can
<code>eval</code> a buffer <code>written in elisp</code> and get you the
answer, this will be very much handy when you want to execute a
<code>file.el</code> file or any where at any buffer. Here, How I have
test it out.</p>
<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a buffer called <code>playground.el</code> or what ever.</li>
<li>put inside the following function (will be mapped later for
emacs-lisp integration with keybinding)</li>
</ol>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(defun eval-and-replace ()
  &quot;Replace the preceding sexp with its value.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (backward-kill-sexp)
  (condition-case nil
      (prin1 (eval (read (current-kill 0)))
             (current-buffer))
    (error (message &quot;Invalid expression&quot;)
           (insert (current-kill 0)))))</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Then run <code>M-x: eval-region</code> so you can load it to your
emacs the function <code>eval-and-replace</code></li>
<li>Now, it is loaded, let use it for given test, it will work only if
inside a <code>emacs-lisp</code> file, so lets make one</li>
</ol>
<pre class="shell"><code>touch testing_elisp.el</code></pre>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Inside that file put</li>
</ol>
<p>(+ 3 4 ) (+ 4 4 ) (+ 5 4 ) - Put the cursor at the end of each
expression and use <code>M-x: eval-and-replace</code>, you will see that
you get the result from this lisp expression.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>You can also apply your macro for a region using
<code>apply-macro-to-region-lines</code>. You need to highlight first
the lines to apply your macro on them.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Notice, the <code>kdb-macro</code> or <code>kmacro</code> is for
keyboard macros which is different from a <code>elisp macro</code>.</li>
<li>You can see your <code>kdb-macro</code> using
<code>kmacro-view-macro</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the article is so important, I decided to put here, - Eval and
Replace</p>
<p>Sometimes people tend to overlook how well Emacs and Emacs Lisp are
integrated. Basically there is no limit to the places where you can
evaluate a bit of Emacs Lisp and reap the associated benefits. From time
to time I find myself editing something and thinking - “Hey, it’d be
really great of I could just insert the result of some Emacs Lisp
expression at point!” (my thoughts are pretty crazy, right?). Here’s a
contrived example - I might have to enter somewhere the result of
<code>1984 / 16</code>. I can calculate that manually or I can fire up
<code>M-x calc</code> and get the result, or I can play extra smart and
devise the following command (which I did not actually devise - I’m
pretty sure I saw it in someone else’s config a while back):</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>
(defun eval-and-replace ()
  &quot;Replace the preceding sexp with its value.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (backward-kill-sexp)
  (condition-case nil
      (prin1 (eval (read (current-kill 0)))
             (current-buffer))
    (error (message &quot;Invalid expression&quot;)
           (insert (current-kill 0)))))</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let’s bind that to C-c e:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c e&quot;) &#39;eval-and-replace)</code></pre>
<p>Now in the buffer I’m currently editing I can type (/ 1984 16) and
press C-c e afterwards getting the result 124 replace the original
expression. Pretty neat! I’ll leave it up to you to think of more
creative applications of the command. This command is available in
<code>crux</code> as <code>crux-eval-and-replace</code>. This command is
also available in prelude via the <code>crux</code> package.</p>
<h2 id="evaluate-more-insights">Evaluate More Insights</h2>
<p>I found a nice way to insert a <code>eval</code> results in
<code>elisp</code> using the following example. - Put the cursor at the
end of each item and run <code>M-x: eval-region</code></p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>(+ 5 7)
(message &quot;hello world&quot;)
(format-time-string &quot;%D %-I:%M %p&quot;)
(insert (concat &quot;the time is &quot;(format-time-string &quot;%D %-I:%M %p&quot;)))</code></pre>
