## CONCEPTS
The following configurations for my `Emacs` are based on `spacemecas`
configurations. Now, everything works flawlessly.

## Quick way to navigate between buffers
| keybinding          | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC TAB or SPC b b: | This keybinding shows a list of open buffers in the current frame. You can navigate through the list using the arrow keys and press RET (Enter) to switch to the selected buffer.     |
| SPC b n or SPC b p: | These keybindings allow you to cycle forward (SPC b n) or backward (SPC b p) through the open buffers. Press the respective keybinding multiple times to switch to different buffers. |
| SPC b 0 to SPC b 9: | These keybindings allow you to quickly switch to buffers numbered from 0 to 9. For example, pressing SPC b 1 will switch to the first buffer in the buffer list.                      |
| SPC b d           : | This keybinding shows a list of recently visited buffers. You can navigate through the list using the arrow keys and press RET (Enter) to switch to the selected buffer.              |

## Tips and Tricks
- You can use either `\`` or `'` to repeat last command you used in your given buffer.

## Configurations with SpaceEmacs
Here is the list of things that I change

- Working with lisp files (barfage, slurpage, & more)

## How to use the LSP
After accessing the `lsp` for the specialized programming language, you can use
either `,` or `<leader>m` (e.g., my leader is mapped to `SPAC`) you can find at
`~/.emacs.d/layers/+lang/common-lisp/README.org` more details to deal with the
`LSP` features.

## Types of shells in Emacs

1. `shell`
2. `e-shell`
3. `ansi-shell`
4. `vterm` (my favorite)


## How to change the color of specific element in Emacs
I followed the description from the `Chat-GPT`. In `spacemacs`, you can change the
color of strings by modifying the syntax highlighting for the relevant
programming language mode. Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Open the file in the relevant programming language mode (e.g. python-mode for
   Python files, ruby-mode for Ruby files, etc.).
2. Press SPC SPC to open the Spacemacs command interface.
3. Type `customize-face` and select it with TAB.
4. Enter the face name for the string in the prompt (e.g.
   `font-lock-string-face` for many programming languages).
5. Press ENTER to select the face name.
6. Select the "Foreground" property and modify the color as desired.

- You may need to restart Spacemacs or
- **Note** I used the customized colors to follow more the `Github` theme using
  - `builtin-face` to change the macros like `prinln!` in Rust.
  - `function-name-face` to change the function name and function call.
  - `string` change the string in `Emacs`
  - `variable-name-face` to change the variable names in emacs.


```emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(font-lock-builtin-face ((t (:foreground "#dcbdfb"))))
 '(font-lock-comment-face ((t (:foreground "#768390"))))
 '(font-lock-function-name-face ((t (:foreground "#dcbdfb"))))
 '(font-lock-keyword-face ((t (:foreground "#f47067"))))
 '(font-lock-string-face ((t (:foreground "#96d0ff"))))
 '(font-lock-variable-name-face ((t (:foreground "#adbac7"))))
 '(markdown-pre-face ((t (:foreground "#f69d50"))))
 '(markdown-url-face ((t (:foreground "#96d0ff" :weight bold))))
 )

```
- Some highlights is not possible for that you can use `customize-face` like the
  one I encoutered with when I used the `markdown` elements to get them
  correctly

## From Scratch
I followed the configurations mentioned in the following thread
- [Emacs from Scratch](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/blob/3075158cae210060888001c0d76a58a4178f6a00/init.el)

## Configurations wiht DOOM Emacs
But before you doom yourself, here are some things you should know:
1. Do not forget to run 'doom sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying init.el
   or packages.el in ~/.config/doom.
   This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
   'doom sync'!
2. If something goes wrong, run `doom doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
   your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.
3. Use 'doom upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
   additional steps. Run 'doom help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.
4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
   (or 'M-x doom/help')
