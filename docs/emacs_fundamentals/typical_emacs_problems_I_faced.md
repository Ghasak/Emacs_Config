# Problems with Emacs

## Faced Issues
Below are the issues I encountered with my current setup:

1. `pdf-tools`: When I try to highlight text in any PDF, Spacemacs suddenly shuts
   down. To address this problem, I removed pdf-tools from my `elpa` package
   list and reinstalled it again on my current computer (rebuild).
2. `org-mode`: Org-mode is not working as expected and there's no syntax
   highlighting. In order to fix this, I also removed org-mode from my `elpa`
   package list and installed it anew.
