# How to input number -series (with appointed amount) in Emacs?


- You can also invoke eval-expression (M-:) and evaluate
```elisp
(dotimes (i 4) (insert (format "%2d.\n" (1+ i))))
```
or

```elisp
(dotimes (i SEQ_LENGTH) (insert (format "%2d\n" (+ START (* i STEP)))))
```
## Using Regular Expression
1. in visual mode, select many lines
2. `<leader> <leader>` then `replace-regexp`
3. use `^`  (to alter beginning of a line)
4. replaced by `\,(1+ \#)` put a sequence of number

## Using multiple-cursors layer
This is a bit tricky, You have the option to create `multiple cursor` and
there are two back-ends. First the `'evil-mc` and `'mc`. I found that `mc`
is not powerful as the `evil-mc` (the `evil-mc` uses the `gr` keybinding).
the `mc` however has the `mc/insert-numbers`.

1. First allow the layer `multiple-curosrs` layer to be installed in
   `spacemacs`.
2. Assign the back-end for the `multiple-cursors` layer using

```elisp
 (multiple-cursors :variables multiple-cursors-backend 'mc)
```
3. Now you need first create several cursor to select how many numbers you want
   to have sequence for. The `mc` back-end is mapped with `<leader>s m` as of
   search multiple-lines. Now you have the option to create cursors using
   `<leader>s m a` to map all the highlighted values.
4. Then, you get
